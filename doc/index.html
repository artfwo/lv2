    <h3>Real Discrete Fourier Transform</h3>
    <p>
      This type of Fourier transform (FT) is used for signals which are discrete <i>and periodic</i>. The information within these signals is therefore finite, even though the signal may be infinitely long. The mathematical tools, however, are often (always?) developed assuming that the signal is infinitely long. The number of samples in a non-repeating chunk of the input signal is denoted as \(N\).

      <ul>
        <li>\(N\): Number of samples in the time domain. \(N\) is often a power of 2, due to the fact that the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operates efficiently on samples of this length.</li>
        <li>A time-domain signal \(x[]\) of length \(N+2\) is equivalent to a frequency-domain signal \(X[]\) of length \(N+1\), consisting of
          <ol>
            <li>the <b>real part</b> \(Re X[]\)  of length \(N/2+1\), each point representing an amplitude of a <b>cosine</b> with a specific frequency</li>
            <li>the <b>imaginary partimaginary part</b> \(Im X[]\) of length \(N/2+1\), each point representing an amplitude of a <b>sine</b> with a specific frequency</li>
          </ol>
      </ul>
